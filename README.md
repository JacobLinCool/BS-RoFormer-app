# BS-RoFormer Vocal Separation

[HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JacobLinCool/bs-roformer)

This is an unofficial demo of the BS-RoFormer vocal separation model, which is the SOTA model for vocal separation. ([MDX23](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/sound-demixing-challenge-2023/problems/music-demixing-track-mdx-23/leaderboards))

Upload an audio file and the model will separate the vocals from the background music.

For comparison, you can also try the Mel-RoFormer model (a variant of BS-RoFormer) and the popular HTDemucs FT model.

> The models are trained by the [UVR project](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui).
