# BS-RoFormer Vocal Separation

This is an unofficial demo of the BS-RoFormer vocal separation model, which is the SOTA model for vocal separation. ([SDX23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02612))

Upload an audio file and the model will separate the vocals from the background music.

> The model (`{MODEL}`) is trained by the [UVR project](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui).
